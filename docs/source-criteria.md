# Source criteria

Any source added to the scraper must meet the following criteria:

## 1. Sources must be government, health organizations, or globally recognized and trustworthy

No news articles, no uncredited/questionable aggregated sources, no Wikipedia.

Examples of trustworthy aggregated sources: New York Times (NYT), Johns Hopkins (JHU).

## 2. Sources must provide the number of cases at a bare minimum

Additional data is welcome.

## 3. Presumptive cases are considered confirmed

In keeping with other datasets, presumptive cases should be considered
part of the case total.

If you have found a source that matches the criteria above, please
consider creating a source for it in this project, so we can include
it in our datasets.
