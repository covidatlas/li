#### Changes

* removed rating, url, featureId
* added locationID (primary key for locations)
* tz is not in an array

#### Multivalent data

The data fields in a given record can be supplied by many sources: one source may return cases and deaths, and another return hospitalizations and tests.  The field `timeseriesSources` shows where each field comes from.

A shorthand is shown for the date ranges for which the sources supplied data.  For example, `"2020-05-21 .. 2020-06-18": "json-source"` means that `json-source` supplied the data from 05-21 to 06-18.

If there are conflicts in the data (e.g., multiple sources return `cases`, but they're inconsistent), a `warnings` element is added.  e.g.,

```
  "warnings": {
    "2020-06-19": {
      "cases": "conflict (src1: 3, src2: 2, src3: 1)",
      "deaths": "conflict (src2: 22, src3: 11)"
    },
    ...
```
